        2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
        50 characters is not a hard limit, just a rule of thumb. Keeping subject lines at this length ensures that they are readable, and forces the author to think for a moment about the most concise way to explain what’s going on.
        
        Tip: If you’re having a hard time summarizing, you might be committing too many changes at once. Strive for atomic commits (a topic for a separate post).
        
        GitHub’s UI is fully aware of these conventions. It will warn you if you go past the 50 character limit:
        
        gh1
        
        And will truncate any subject line longer than 72 characters with an ellipsis:
        
        gh2
        
        So shoot for 50 characters, but consider 72 the hard limit.
        
        3. Capitalize the subject line
        This is as simple as it sounds. Begin all subject lines with a capital letter.
        
        For example:
        
        Accelerate to 88 miles per hour
        Instead of:
        
        accelerate to 88 miles per hour
        4. Do not end the subject line with a period
        Trailing punctuation is unnecessary in subject lines. Besides, space is precious when you’re trying to keep them to 50 chars or less.
        
        Example:
        
        Open the pod bay doors
        Instead of:
        
        Open the pod bay doors.
        5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
        Imperative mood just means “spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction”. A few examples:
        
        Clean your room
        Close the door
        Take out the trash
        Each of the seven rules you’re reading about right now are written in the imperative (“Wrap the body at 72 characters”, etc.).
        
        The imperative can sound a little rude; that’s why we don’t often use it. But it’s perfect for Git commit subject lines. One reason for this is that Git itself uses the imperative whenever it creates a commit on your behalf.
        
        For example, the default message created when using git merge reads:
        
        Merge branch 'myfeature'
        And when using git revert:
        
        Revert "Add the thing with the stuff"
        
        This reverts commit cc87791524aedd593cff5a74532befe7ab69ce9d.
        Or when clicking the “Merge” button on a GitHub pull request:
        
        Merge pull request #123 from someuser/somebranch
        So when you write your commit messages in the imperative, you’re following Git’s own built-in conventions. For example:
        
        Refactor subsystem X for readability
        Update getting started documentation
        Remove deprecated methods
        Release version 1.0.0
        Writing this way can be a little awkward at first. We’re more used to speaking in the indicative mood, which is all about reporting facts. That’s why commit messages often end up reading like this:
        
        Fixed bug with Y
        Changing behavior of X
        And sometimes commit messages get written as a description of their contents:
        
        More fixes for broken stuff
        Sweet new API methods
        To remove any confusion, here’s a simple rule to get it right every time.
        
        A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:
        
        If applied, this commit will your subject line here
        For example:
        
        If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability
        If applied, this commit will update getting started documentation
        If applied, this commit will remove deprecated methods
        If applied, this commit will release version 1.0.0
        If applied, this commit will merge pull request #123 from user/branch
        Notice how this doesn’t work for the other non-imperative forms:
        
        If applied, this commit will fixed bug with Y
        If applied, this commit will changing behavior of X
        If applied, this commit will more fixes for broken stuff
        If applied, this commit will sweet new API methods
        Remember: Use of the imperative is important only in the subject line. You can relax this restriction when you’re writing the body.
